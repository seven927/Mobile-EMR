Mobile-EMR
==========
This is an Android application which implements SSL protocl and is used to access the user information and medical records
securely. Use keytool to generate the private key and the certificate. Here I only implement authentication of server for
client. User need password to log in. In the project the example.txt records some username and password as examples.
